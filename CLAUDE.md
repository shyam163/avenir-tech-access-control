# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the development of an access control system with building automation proposal by **Quantum Automata** for **Avenir Tech** (owned by Irshad). The system integrates:

- Access Control
- HVAC Management
- Power Monitoring
- Security Systems
- Surveillance

Currently in planning stage with architectural diagrams stored in the `diagrams/` directory.

└── HVAC diagram.pdf                  # HVAC system diagrams
```

## File Types and Content

- **Building Plans**: Floor layouts for ground, first, and second floors
- **Plumbing Diagrams**: Water supply and drainage system layouts
- **Electrical Diagrams**: Electrical wiring and circuit plans
- **HVAC Diagrams**: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system layouts
- **Combined Drawings**: Comprehensive architectural drawings with multiple systems

## Project Context

**Service Provider**: Quantum Automata
**Client Company**: Avenir Tech
**Client Owner**: Irshad
**Project**: Integrated Access Control & Building Automation System
**Current Phase**: Proposal and Technical Specifications

The building diagrams serve as reference for understanding the physical infrastructure that the access control system will manage and monitor.

## Working with This Repository

### Current Phase - Planning
- Building diagrams are in `diagrams/` directory for infrastructure reference
- Use Read tool to examine PDF contents when planning system integration
- Reference existing electrical, HVAC, and plumbing layouts when designing automation interfaces

### System Integration Points
- **HVAC**: Integration with existing HVAC systems shown in `diagrams/HVAC diagram.pdf`
- **Electrical**: Power monitoring will interface with electrical systems in `diagrams/electrical diagram .pdf`
- **Security**: Physical security layout based on floor plans in `diagrams/ground floor first floor second floor plan.pdf`
- **Access Control**: Entry points and zones defined by building layout

## Common Tasks

- **Viewing building diagrams**: Use Read tool with specific PDF file path
- **Planning system integration**: Reference diagrams to understand physical infrastructure
- **Designing automation workflows**: Consider building layout and existing systems
